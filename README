Elitist genetic programming in Python

This project implements a fully featured standalone GENETIC PROGRAMMING system
with elitist support for solving the SYMBOLIC REGRESSION task. It was originally
created for the purposes of individual practice for Brno International Summer
School in Information Technology (BISSIT) 2021, https://www.fit.vut.cz/events/bissit/,
but may be useful as a more general educational and research tool in soft computing.
See comments in the source code for details.

Please install the graphviz library from https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/
for the tree visualizations of resulting functions.
